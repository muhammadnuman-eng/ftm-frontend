# Affiliate Area - Production Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Build Errors ✅
Fixed type errors in `translate-posts.ts` that were preventing the build from completing.

### 2. Dynamic Rendering Configuration ✅
Added proper Next.js configuration to ensure affiliate-area pages are dynamically rendered at request time (not statically pre-rendered at build time):

**Files Updated:**
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/layout.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/statistics/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/payouts/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/referrals/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/visits/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/urls/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/coupons/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/affiliate-area/graphs/page.tsx`

**Configuration Added:**
```typescript
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export const dynamicParams = true;  // in layout only
export const revalidate = 0;
```

### 3. Error Handling ✅
Added comprehensive error handling to gracefully handle missing configuration or API failures:

- Dashboard page now shows user-friendly error messages
- Layout handles authentication errors without crashing
- Development mode shows detailed error information for debugging

### 4. API Timeout Protection ✅
Added 15-second timeouts to all AffiliateWP API calls to prevent indefinite hanging:

**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/affiliatewp.ts`
- Created `fetchWithTimeout()` wrapper function
- Applied to all critical API endpoints:
  - `getAffiliateById()`
  - `getAffiliateRateInfo()`
  - `getAffiliateReferrals()`
  - `getAffiliateVisits()`
  - `getAffiliatePayouts()`

### 5. Better Error Logging ✅
Improved error logging to help identify missing environment variables.

## Why These Changes Were Needed

The affiliate-area wasn't working in Vercel deployment for several reasons:

1. **Static Pre-rendering**: Next.js was trying to pre-render the authenticated pages at build time, which doesn't work because:
   - Authentication checks require cookies (not available at build time)
   - API calls need environment variables and network access
   - User-specific data can't be pre-rendered

2. **Missing Error Boundaries**: If any API call failed, the entire page would crash without a useful error message.

3. **No Timeout Protection**: If the AffiliateWP API was slow or unreachable, the page would hang indefinitely.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push Changes to Git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix affiliate-area production deployment issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

   Required variables:
   - `AFFILIATEWP_API_URL`
   - `AFFILIATEWP_API_PUBLIC_KEY`
   - `AFFILIATEWP_API_TOKEN`
   - `AFFILIATE_JWT_SECRET` (recommended, optional)

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to your main branch
   - Or manually trigger a deployment from the Vercel dashboard

4. **Test the Deployment:**
   - Go to `https://your-domain.com/affiliate-area/login`
   - Try logging in with test credentials
   - Check that the dashboard loads properly
   - Navigate through different affiliate-area pages

## Debugging in Production

If the affiliate-area still doesn't work:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Functions
   - Look for errors related to affiliate-area routes

2. **Check for Timeout Errors:**
   - Look for "Request timeout after 15000ms" in the logs
   - This indicates the AffiliateWP API is unreachable or too slow

3. **Verify API Connectivity:**
   - Ensure Vercel's servers can reach your WordPress/AffiliateWP API
   - Check if there are any firewall rules blocking Vercel's IP addresses
   - Test the API endpoint manually from Vercel's region

4. **Check Cookie Settings:**
   - Verify cookies are being set properly in the browser
   - Check browser DevTools → Application → Cookies
   - Look for `affiliate_session` cookie

## Testing Locally

To test these changes locally:

```bash
# Build the project
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000/affiliate-area/login
```

## What's Different Now

**Before:**
- ● Pages marked as static (pre-rendered at build time)
- No error handling for API failures
- No timeout protection
- Pages would crash if configuration was missing

**After:**
- ƒ Pages marked as dynamic (rendered on each request) 
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- 15-second timeouts on all API calls
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Additional Notes

- Login and register pages are client components and were already dynamic
- The main dashboard and all sub-pages now have proper authentication checks
- All API calls use `cache: 'no-store'` to prevent stale data
- Error messages are production-safe (detailed errors only in development)
