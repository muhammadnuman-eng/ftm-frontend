            <h2>Understanding Funded Trading Programs</h2>
            <p>Funded trading programs have become increasingly popular among traders looking to access larger capital without risking their own money. These programs typically involve a two-step process: first, you prove your trading skills through a challenge, and then you get funded with real capital.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Factors to Consider</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Program Structure:</strong> Some programs have time limits, while others are more flexible</li>
                <li><strong>Drawdown Limits:</strong> Understand the maximum loss you can incur</li>
                <li><strong>Profit Split:</strong> Know what percentage of profits you'll keep</li>
                <li><strong>Account Size:</strong> Consider the initial and scaling account sizes</li>
                <li><strong>Platform Support:</strong> Ensure the program supports your preferred trading platform</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>1-Step vs 2-Step Programs</h3>
            <p>1-step programs typically have higher profit targets but no time limits, making them ideal for patient traders. 2-step programs have lower initial targets but require you to maintain consistency across two phases.</p>
            
            <h3>Making Your Decision</h3>
            <p>Consider your trading style, risk tolerance, and time availability when choosing between different program types. Remember that consistency and discipline are more important than trying to rush through the evaluation process.</p>

            "Identify and overcome the most common psychological pitfalls that can derail your funded trading journey.",
        content: `
            <h2>The Mental Game of Trading</h2>
            <p>Trading psychology often determines success more than technical analysis or fundamental knowledge. Understanding common psychological mistakes can help you avoid costly errors.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Revenge Trading</h3>
            <p>After a loss, many traders try to immediately recover by taking larger positions or ignoring their trading plan. This emotional response typically leads to even bigger losses.</p>
            
            <h3>2. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)</h3>
            <p>Entering trades late because you're afraid of missing a move often results in poor entry prices and increased risk. Stick to your analysis and wait for proper setups.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Overconfidence</h3>
            <p>After a series of winning trades, traders may become overconfident and abandon their risk management rules. Remember that markets are unpredictable.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Analysis Paralysis</h3>
            <p>Over-analyzing can lead to missed opportunities and increased stress. Develop a clear trading plan and stick to it.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Ignoring Market Conditions</h3>
            <p>Not all strategies work in all market conditions. Adapt your approach based on current volatility and trend strength.</p>
            
            <h3>Building Mental Resilience</h3>
            <p>Develop a routine that includes meditation, exercise, and proper sleep to maintain mental clarity and emotional balance.</p>

        content: `
            <h2>Understanding Price Action</h2>
            <p>Technical analysis is the study of price movements and patterns to predict future market behavior. For funded traders, mastering these fundamentals is crucial for consistent performance.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Chart Patterns</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Support and Resistance:</strong> Identify key price levels where buying/selling pressure increases</li>
                <li><strong>Trend Lines:</strong> Draw lines connecting higher highs or lower lows</li>
                <li><strong>Chart Patterns:</strong> Recognize formations like triangles, flags, and head & shoulders</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Essential Indicators</h3>
            <h4>Moving Averages</h4>
            <p>Use simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA) to identify trends and potential reversal points.</p>
            
            <h4>RSI (Relative Strength Index)</h4>
            <p>Measures momentum and helps identify overbought/oversold conditions. Values above 70 indicate overbought, below 30 indicate oversold.</p>
            
            <h4>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</h4>
            <p>Combines trend and momentum analysis to generate buy/sell signals.</p>
            
            <h3>Volume Analysis</h3>
            <p>Volume confirms price movements. High volume on breakouts increases the likelihood of continued movement in that direction.</p>
            
            <h3>Multiple Timeframe Analysis</h3>
            <p>Always analyze multiple timeframes to get a complete picture. Use higher timeframes for trend direction and lower timeframes for entry timing.</p>
